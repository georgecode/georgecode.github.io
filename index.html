      <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pizza-shop-san-francisco"><h3>The Pizza Shop</h3></a>
      <p>The pizza at this place is the best in SF hands down. I consider myself a pizza snob/expert ! I almost gave up on San Francisco pizza after trying so many bad pizza places in the city, but alas this place met my NY/NJ pizza standards, and my pants have gone up a size as proof.   </p>

        <li>Plain slice</li>
